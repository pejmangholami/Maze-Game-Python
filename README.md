# Python Maze Generation and Solver

This is a university project demonstrating the application of recursive functions for generating and solving a maze. The program was originally written in C++ and has been translated to Python.

## Features
- Random maze generation using a modified depth-first approach.
- Maze solving using a recursive depth-first search algorithm.
- Console-based visualization of maze generation and solving steps, including animations.
- User-configurable maze dimensions.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure `maze_game.py` is in your current directory.
3. Run the script from your terminal: `python maze_game.py`
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the maze size when asked.
